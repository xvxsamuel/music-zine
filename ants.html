                    <p>bc,nr is a 7-man band comprised of band kids who gained notoriety as a live band playing small gigs in the london underground scene. while that sounds like quite possibly the least likable combination of circumstances for any artist ever, the raw talent of the band is so apparent that even the most unlikely people are willing to give them a chance.</p>
                    <p>i was one of those people back at the start of 2022 and it opened my eyes (or ears lol) to a world that i had never even known existed. it made me actively want to seek music just for the emotional response to the artform.</p>
                    <p>the writing style of isaac wood—the frontman of the group who left the band after the release of this album because he did not want to retraumatize himself by singing the lyrics—is so deeply personal, relying on references and metaphors that feel all too familiar to anyone able to relate. the vague glimpses into this collapsing relationship eventually help the listener paint a heartwrenching picture using their own experiences. lyrically, each song is a masterfully written emotional rollercoaster full of longing, melancholy and the bittersweet delusions of codependency. to complement this, isaac's vocal style is raw, sometimes even sounding on the verge of tears. combined with the lyrical matter, it makes for a truly powerful experience.</p>
                    <p>now, if you don't relate or don't want to relate to these themes, you might ask yourself why you'd willingly put yourself through something like this.</p>
                    <p>that's when the rest of the band comes in. each member of the group carries their weight twentyfold. the musicianship of each member is showcased in a way that never feels unbalanced, resulting in the most beautiful soundscapes you can imagine. every song is live recorded. when the song gets quiet, you can hear breathing and movement in the room. it feels authentic and pure. after hundreds of listens, i still pick up on details that i didn't hear the previous time around.</p>
                    <p>many of the songs on this album have a build up and a crescendo, they all feel like their own story in its own way, it's impossible to not feel emotional whiplash after listening to it. despite the lyrical content, the instrumentation is so lush and beautiful it keeps you wanting more. in a funny way, the bittersweet codependent themes of the album can extend to the relationship of the listener to the music itself.</p> 
                    <p>it is a grand, complex yet seamless combination of post-rock and classical elements that somehow manages to never come off as pretentious. every word feels genuine, with every chord and melody serving as a beautiful backdrop to amplify the emotional impact of isaac's writing, it's perfect.</p>
