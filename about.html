                    <p>i’m samuel and i love music!!</p>
                    <p>this is my webzine in which i will be sharing my experiences with music. <b><a href="info">click here</a> for more information about the site itself.</b></p>
                    <p>as a person with a terrible attention span but a great appreciation for art, music quickly became my go-to artform to consume. it somehow never feels stale or boring, i could be listening every waking hour and still not get tired of it.</p> 
                    <p>thanks to my dad, i had a very early introduction to music. growing up, he showed me artists like kanye or gorillaz, which certainly influenced my music taste later down the line. music has always been an active part of his life too, even writing lyrics for a <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/HzpIIWyTLUQ">soviet era slovak version of depeche mode</a>, as the real thing was banned in my country. he always tried showing everyone new music from all sorts of genres, i remember him bringing home the first lady gaga cd and my mom laughing at him for thinking she's ever going to be popular.</p>
                    <p>it was him who gifted me a wii and guitar hero for christmas when i was 7, which is how i started discovering new music myself. i never heard music like <i>that</i> on the radio. i fell in love with it on many levels. eventually, my passion grew and grew as and i learned to play the drums and guitar, attending shows, then started collecting vinyl, and now i'm here.</p>
                    <p>i started with rock music like <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/K4dx42YzQCE">the white stripes</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/OnuuYcqhzCE">nu metal bands of the time</a>, then i found <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/huWgN-cpyKw">death metal</a> and immediatelly fell in love. i remember walking into hard rock cafe when i was 8 or 9 and talking about death metal with the cashier. i felt like the coolest kid in the world.</p>
                    <p>from there, i expanded my taste by exploring <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/m_6dkzL4VS4">prog</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/bSgclvVMF3U">speed metal</a> bands, and <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/-ZENtivAi6I">black metal</a> projects. wanting a change of pace, when i was around 14, i got into hip-hop thanks to kendrick and kanye. before that, i believed a lot of the negative stereotypes associated with hip-hop but the undeniable talent and quality of these artists won me over. i quickly realized i was wrong, ignoring this whole part of the music world. i was in my hiphop phase until around 2022, which is when—thanks to a <a target="_blank" href="./albums/ants">certain album</a>—i started rediscovering genres i fell in love with in the past while also wanting seek out new exciting music to experience.</p>
                    <p>music has helped me get through the toughest periods of life, shaped me into the person i am today while connecting me to the people who mean the most to me. listening to my favorite albums and attending shows are some of my fondest memories and i’d love if i could share those experiences with you, so you could get inspired and find your own meaning in this beautiful artform.</p>
